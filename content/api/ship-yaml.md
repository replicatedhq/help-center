## Ship

Ship is a flexible workflow tool that allows you to package your application for delivering it as an on-prem application to your customers. This is the reference documentation for the Ship yaml Spec. To get started with ship, check out the [Ship Guides](https://ship.replicated.com)

- [Ship Assets](/api/ship-assets/assets) allow you to define what files and application artifacts should be delivered to end customers
- [Ship Config](/api/ship-config/config) allows you to define what dynamic configuration options your end customers need to supply to configure your application to run in their on-prem environment.
- [Ship Lifecycle](/api/ship-lifecycle/lifecycle) allows you to customize the installation workflow and messaging for your end customers.
