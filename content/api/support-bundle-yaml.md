## Support Bundle

Replicated's standalone Support Bundle allows you to diagnose problems with any app, deployed any way, anywhere. This is the reference documentation for the Support Bundle YAML syntax.

- [Support Bundle Collection Specs](/api/support-bundle-yaml-specs/shared) allows you to specify which commands to run and files to collect to gather diagnostic info about your on-premise application.
- [Support Bundle Collection Lifecycle](/api/support-bundle-yaml-lifecycle/root) allows you to modify the end-customer's experience with custom messaging, automatic analysis of collected files, and more.
