## Troubleshoot

Replicated's Troubleshoot product allows you to allows you to diagnose problems with any app, deployed any way, anywhere. This is the reference documentation for the Support Bundle and Analyze YAML syntax.

## Support Bundle

- [Support Bundle Collection Specs](/api/support-bundle-yaml-specs/shared/) allows you to specify which commands to run and files to collect to gather diagnostic info about your on-premise application.
- [Support Bundle Collection Lifecycle](/api/support-bundle-yaml-lifecycle/root/) allows you to modify the end-customer's experience with custom messaging, automatic analysis of collected files, and more.

## Analyze

- [Analyze Specs](/api/analyze-yaml-specs/root/) allows you to analyze diagnostic information gathered about your on-premise application and surface relevant information and errors to your end-customer.
