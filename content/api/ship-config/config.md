## Ship Config

This is the reference documenation for Ship config. To get started with Ship, head on over to [Shipping a Helm Application](/guides/helm-application/)

The configuration options API is identical to that used for applications managed by
Replicated's scheduler suite, and the documentation can be found at [Config Screen YAML
](/docs/config-screen/config-yaml/).
