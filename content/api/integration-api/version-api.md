The Version API provides endpoints for your application to read the current application version, release notes, pending updates and apply updates. Applications that use automatic updates can use this to notify users of pending updates and apply them without having to visit the Replicated console.

## Version API

The Version API is part of the Integration API. To discover the Integration API base endpoint, query the REPLICATED_INTEGRATIONAPI environment variable from inside your container.

### GET /version/v1/current

Returns information describing the current version of the application running.

#### Example request:

cURL

```shell
curl -k $REPLICATED_INTEGRATIONAPI/version/v1/current
```

#### Example response:

HTTP

```json
{
  "version": "100",
  "release_sequence": 51,
  "release_notes": "The release notes",
  "release_date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00.0000000Z",
  "install_date": "2016-01-01T21:00:00.0000000Z"
}
```

### GET /version/v1/updates

Returns a list of available updates to install.

### PUT /version/v1/:sequence

Apply a pending update to the installation. Note that this will install the update immediately and could cause downtime.
