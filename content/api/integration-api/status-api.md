The Status API provides a method for user applications to update the status of an application during it's startup lifecycle. For applications with multiple startup steps, this can be used to inform users of long-running actions such as migrations and bootstrapping. The Status API can also aid in debugging by giving users insight into the application startup phase they experienced an issue with.

## Status API Endpoint

The Status API is part of the Integration API. To discover the Integration API base endpoint, query the REPLICATED_INTEGRATIONAPI environment variable from inside your container.

All methods return result as JSON. If Accept header is included in the request, it must contain _/_ or application/json. If neither of these values is present, the request will fail with status 400.

### PUT /status/v1/startup

Sets the app's startup progress text to any arbitrary string. The string will be displayed in the "app status" tile of the management console, allowing you to provide real-time feedback about your app's startup progress to the end user.
