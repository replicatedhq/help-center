The Replicated Vendor API is available to create and manage applications, release, customers, licenses, and more.

We publish a swagger spec at [https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v1/spec/vendor-api.json](https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v1/spec/vendor-api.json). We also have an interactive API console available at [https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/v1.0/reference](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/v1.0/reference)

Interacting with the Vendor API requires [Finding your API Token and App ID](/docs/kb/developer-resources/finding-your-api-token-and-app-id).
