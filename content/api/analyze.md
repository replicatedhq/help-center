## Analyze

Replicated's Analyze product allows you to surface insights from your troubleshoot bundles about your end-customer installations. This is the reference documentation for the Analyze YAML syntax.

- [Analyze Variable Specs](/api/analyze-yaml-variable-specs/root/) allows you to gather and store information from your customer's on-prem application via a troubleshoot bundle that can be used to make assertions via Analyze Conditions.
- [Analyze Condition Specs](/api/analyze-yaml-condition-specs/root/) allows you to make assertions on information gathered from your customer's on-prem application via a troubleshoot bundle through Analyze Variables.
