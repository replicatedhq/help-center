## helm

A `helm` asset will template and render an existing helm chart. You can either reference an existing chart in a private or public github repo, or your installer runbook can include assets to drop an existing helm chart at `local.chart_root`.

### Required Parameters


- `dest` - The directory in which to render the chart. If the source chart is at `charts/src/nginx`, and `dest` is set to `charts/rendered/`, then the chart will be templated at `charts/rendered/nginx`


    
### Optional Parameters


- `github` - Configuration for indicating a chart hosted in a private or public github repo. Fields are same as `assets.v1.github`


- `helm_opts` - Additional options as would be passed to `helm template`


- `local` - Configuration for indicating an already existing source chart to render from.


- `values` - Values to set during rendering, overrides defaults in `values.yaml` if present in the chart root.
