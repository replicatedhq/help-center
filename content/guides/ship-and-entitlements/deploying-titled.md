# Deploying the Titled Service

Another option to deliver entitlements to your Replicated Ship application is to deploy the Titled service. Titled provides RESTful endpoints to fetch entitlements for a single installation of your application. Titled is made available to you as a Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/replicated/titled.

{{< linked_headline "Securing your Entitlements" >}}

This option provides a more secure way to ingest entitlements in your customer's infrastructure. The Titled service verifies signed entitlements from the Replicated servers before delivering them to your app.

{{< linked_headline "Running the Titled Service" >}}

Defining the following Ship asset will render a Kubernetes YAML file that will make the Titled service available to your application at http://titled:3000/. For example, `curl http://titled:3000/license/v1/license` or `curl http://titled:3000/license/v1/field/<field-name>`. For more documentation, refer to the [Integration API](/api/integration-api/license-api/) reference.

It is also possible to run the Titled service in Airgapped environments. A signed entitlements payload can be included as a ConfigMap and used in the Titled deployment to deliver entitlements to your application. The following Ship asset will render both the ConfigMap and the Titled deployment serving your entitlements from a file:

```yaml
assets:
  v1:
    - inline:
        contents: |
          ---
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: titled
          data:
            entitlements.conf: |
              {{repl ShipCustomerRelease | Base64Encode }}
          ---
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          metadata:
            name: titled
            labels:
              app: titled
          spec:
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: titled
            template:
              metadata:
                labels:

                  name: titled
                  args: ["serve", "--serve_from_file", "/titled/entitlements.conf"]
                  ports:
                  - containerPort: 3000
                    name: titled
                    protocol: TCP
                  volumeMounts:
                  - mountPath: /titled
                    name: titled
                volumes:
                - configMap:
                    name: titled
                  name: titled
          ---
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: titled
            labels:
              app: titled
          spec:

            ports:
