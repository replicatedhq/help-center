# Introduction to Entitlements and Ship

Replicated Ship applications can deliver customer-specific license fields (entitlements), that can be read and consumed by an application. Entitlements can be used to enforce application specific privileges that govern what an application user can do. This guide will walk you through the process of using Replicated's licensing functionality to deliver entitlements down to your application.

This guide assumes you have an application already bundled with Replicated Ship. To get started with Ship follow [this guide](/guides/kubernetes-with-ship/).

The [next section](/guides/ship-and-entitlements/license-fields/) will guide you in getting started defining custom License Fields for your Replicated Ship application.
