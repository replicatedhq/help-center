# Tested SAML Providers

Replicated tests several SAML providers, but the service should be compatible with any SAML 2.0 compliant service provider. We provide setup instructions and support for the following SAML providers.

### Okta

### OneLogin

If your team is using OneLogin, it's also fully supported. To understand how to set this up, head over to our [OneLogin Guide](../onelogin).
