Iterating on your Replicated [application YAML](https://help.replicated.com/docs/packaging-an-application/yaml-overview/) can be quite cumbersom. Often the developer will choose to make changes to the YAML on their local filesystem in their text editor of choice. Once changes have been made, a release must be created and promoted to a channel via the [Replicated Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/) or the [Replicated CLI](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated), before that release will become available in the Replicated admin console. Likely there will be many more iterations on that release before it is ready to be shipped to the customer. The [Replicated Developer Studio](https://github.com/replicatedhq/studio) has been designed with developers in mind, to streamline the development cycle, by allowing for local YAML changes to reflect almost immediately in the Admin console. This provides a quick way to iterate and test new versions of an application, bypassing Replicated's APIs.

## Getting started

1. Follow the [README](https://github.com/replicatedhq/studio) and install Replicated and Studio.
