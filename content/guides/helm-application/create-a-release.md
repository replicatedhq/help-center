{{< linked_headline "Create a Customer" >}}

To begin, log in (or create an account) on [console.replicated.com](https://console.replicated.com). If you already have an account on [vendor.replicated.com](https://vendor.replicated.com), you can use it here too. After signing up and activating your account, you'll be presented with the opportunity to create a new customer. Here we'll be using 'ATestCustomer'.

{{< linked_headline "Navigate To Ship" >}}

The Ship product page can be found through the 'Products' dropdown.

If you haven't visited before, you'll see a prompt to get started with Release Channels.

![Release Channels](/images/guides/ship/release-channels.png)

{{< linked_headline "Get Started With Release Channels" >}}

By default, three release channels are created - Stable, Beta and Nightly. We'll start with a release on the Nightly channel. Once we've done some testing, we'll promote it to Beta.

{{< linked_headline "Editing a Release" >}}

A Ship release is a yaml file describing the assets to include, the configuration options to present to the installer, and what text to display at runtime. We'll use the builtin editor on console to get started.

![Edit Yaml](/images/guides/ship/edit-release.png)

There are three sections to the Ship yaml - assets, config, and lifecycle.

{{< linked_headline "Assets" >}}

```yaml
assets:
  v1:
  - inline:
      contents: |
        #!/bin/sh
        git clone git@gitlab.com:charts/gitlab.git
        helm dependencies update
        helm upgrade --install gitlab . \
          --timeout 600 \
          --set global.hosts.domain={{repl config "domain_name"}} \
          {{repl if {{repl config "external_ip"}} }}--set global.hosts.externalIP={{repl config "external_ip"}}{{end}} \
          --set gitlab.migrations.initialRootPassword={{repl config "gitlab_root_password"}} \
          --set certmanager-issuer.email={{repl config "certificate_email"}} \
          {{repl if {{repl config "external_postgres"}} }} --set global.psql.host={{repl config "postgres_host"}} \
          --set global.psql.password.secret={{repl config "postgres_k8s_secret_name"}} \
          --set global.psql.password.key={{repl config "postgres_password"}} {{repl end}} \
          {{repl if {{repl config "redis_ha"}} }}--set redis.enabled=false --set redis-ha.enabled=true{{repl end}}

      dest: ./gitlab/scripts/install.sh
      mode: 0777
```

  The `assets` section describes the files that ship will create when run. There are two types of assets currently supported in Ship, though we'll only be using `inline` here. `inline` assets create templated files at the destination location, while `docker` assets do the same with exported Docker images. For the purposes of this demo, we'll be using public Docker images with no allowance for airgapped installations, but normally we would explicitly include all the Docker images within the Ship yaml.

{{< linked_headline "Config" >}}

```yaml
config:
  v1:
    - name: config_options
      title: Gitlab Configuration Options
      description: The options required by GitLab
      items:
      - name: domain_name
        title: Domain Name
        description: Specify a domain which will contain records to resolve gitlab, registry, and minio to the appropriate IP for your chart
        type: text
        required: true
      - name: external_ip
        title: External IP
        description: If you plan to manually configure your DNS records they should all point to a static IP. For example if you choose example.local and you have a static IP of 10.10.10.10, then gitlab.example.local, registry.example.local and minio.example.local should all resolve to 10.10.10.10.
        type: text
        required: false
      - name: gitlab_root_password
        title: Gitlab Root Password
        description: The initial root password for GitLab.
        type: password
        required: true
      - name: certificate_email
        title: Certificate Email
        description: The email to associate with the letsencrypt certificates generated by cert-manager.
        type: text
        required: true
      - name: external_postgres
        title: Use an External Postgres Database
        type: bool
        required: true
      - name: postgres_host
        title: External Postgres Host
        description: The hostname of the external postgres instance GitLab should use
        type: text
        when: '{{repl ConfigOptionEquals "external_postgres" "1"}}'
        required: true
      - name: postgres_k8s_secret_name
        title: External Postgres Kubernetes Secret Name
        description: The name of the Kubernetes secret Postgres should use
        type: text
        when: '{{repl ConfigOptionEquals "external_postgres" "1"}}'
        required: true
      - name: postgres_password
        title: External Postgres Password
        description: The key of the password for  the external postgres instance GitLab should use
        type: password
        when: '{{repl ConfigOptionEquals "external_postgres" "1"}}'
        required: true
      - name: redis_ha
        title: Redis-ha
        description: Use high availibility Redis-ha
        type: bool
```

  The `configuration` section uses the same layout and structure as that of Replicated, and is greatly expanded upon [here](https://help.replicated.com/docs/config-screen/config-yaml/). There is one exception - 'when' fields can only be templatable strings. We'll use it to determine what settings the user would like for their GitLab installation.

{{< linked_headline "Lifecycle" >}}

```yaml
lifecycle:
  v1:
    - message:
        contents: |
          This tool will prepare assets so you can deploy GitLab-Enterpise
          to your existing Kubernetes cluster
    - render: {}
    - message:
        contents: |
          GitLab is ready to deploy to your kubernetes cluster.

          If you have Helm configured locally, you can
          run the following command to deploy GitLab to
          your kubernetes cluster:

              bash ./gitlab/scripts/install.sh
    - message:
        level: warn
        contents: |
          A state file has been written to {{repl context "state_file_path" }} -- please store it
          somewhere safe, you'll need it if you want to recover or update this installation of GitLab.
```

  The `lifecycle` section is the messaging that will be seen by the end user. Contents will be printed to the screen in order during execution, with `render: {}` being replaced with the configuration options. Message levels change the color of the rendered text, and can be `debug`, `info` (the default), `warn` or `error`.

Once we've finished editing our yaml, we can create a release from it.

![Create Release](/images/guides/ship/create-release.png)

{{< linked_headline "Add Customer To Channel" >}}

Before we can test our app, we need to add a customer to the channel. Since Nightly releases shouldn't be going to production, we'll add ATestCustomer.

![Add Customer To Channel](/images/guides/ship/channel-details-withcust.png)

{{< linked_headline "Next Steps" >}}

Now that's we've created and shipped the first version of our application, continue to the [next section](../installing) to learn how an enterprise customer will install this release.
