A policy is defined in a single JSON document.

```json
{
  "v1": {
    "name": "Read Only",
    "resources": {
      "allowed": [
        "**/read",
        "**/list"
      ],
      "denied": [
        "**/*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

 There is some minimal metadata included, but the primary contents of a policy document is the `resources` key. The `resources` key should contain two arrays, identified as `allowed` and `denied`. As the names indicate, resources specified in the `allowed` list will be allowed for users assigned to the policy, and resources specified in the `denied` list will be denied.

 Resource names are hierarchical, and support wildcards and globs. It's possible to create a policy document that has conflicting rules, and the behavior here is [predictable and documented](../rule-order).

For a complete list of resource names that can be defined in a policy document, continue to the [Resource Names](../resource-names) list.
