If you promote a release to a channel but later realize there is a issue you can use the 
[vendor web](https://vendor.replicated.com/) to fix the problem quickly.

Possible issues would be:

- Release had been marked as “required” and now should be skipped.
- Misspelling in the release notes.
- Version number was mislabeled.

## Step 1: Click on the Channel of the release that you want to fix.
