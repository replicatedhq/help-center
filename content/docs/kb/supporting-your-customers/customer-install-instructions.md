When you are creating documentation for your customers to install your application via 
Replicated, we always recommend starting with our [official installation instructions]
(/distributing-an-application/installing/). However, it can be helpful to 
see what the installation instructions of other customers look like today:

[GetElk is an example app](/examples/getelk/) that we created with open sourced YAML and components.

SysDig provides detailed instructions on installation for both a single host version and a multi-host distributed version of their application. 
[SysDig Enterprise Installation Guide](http://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/206519903-On-Premises-Installation-Guide).

CodeClimate provides a great example of how to communicate the entire process from start.
