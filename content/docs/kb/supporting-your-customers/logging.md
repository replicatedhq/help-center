The default log level in Replicated is `info`. Available log levels are `error`, `warn`, `info` and `debug`. To change the log level in Replicated you will need to edit Replicated's config files and then restart. Replicated's services are configured via the files `/etc/default/replicated` and `/etc/default/replicated-operator` or `/etc/sysconfig/replicated` and `/etc/sysconfig/replicated-operator` depending on your distribution. You will then need to modify the `REPLICATED_OPTS` and `REPLICATED_OPERATOR_OPTS` entries respectively so that `LOG_LEVEL` is set appropriately. Once you have made the changes and saved the files, you must then restart Replicated for your changes to take effect. You can find instructions on restarting Replicated [here](/docs/distributing-an-application/installing-via-script/#restarting-replicated).

Below is an example `/etc/default/replicated` configuration file with Replicated's log level set to debug:

```
RELEASE_CHANNEL=stable
PRIVATE_ADDRESS=10.128.0.8
SKIP_OPERATOR_INSTALL=0
REPLICATED_OPTS=" -e DAEMON_TOKEN=mrHgGWUlBdt1gmDTU7QU3d4xwCFA -e LOG_LEVEL=debug -e NODENAME=testing.replicated.internal"
REPLICATED_UI_OPTS=""
```
