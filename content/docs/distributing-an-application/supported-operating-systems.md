Replicated supports Linux-based servers that can run current versions of Docker.

Your machine must support docker-engine {{< docker_version_minimum >}} - {{< docker_version_default >}}
(with {{< docker_version_default >}} being the recommended version). This also requires a 64-bit distribution with a
kernel minimum of 3.10.

Replicated provides an easy install script to work with the the following list of operating system.

- Debian 7.7+
- Ubuntu 14.04 / 15.10 / 16.04
- Fedora 21 / 22
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5+
- CentOS 6+
- Amazon Linux 2014.03 / 2014.09 / 2015.03 / 2015.09 / 2016.03 / 2016.09 / 2017.03
- Oracle Linux 6.5+

As new operating systems start to support Docker we extend our install script and QA process to include them.  Operating
systems that support Docker but are not yet included in the easy install script can still be used
using the [manual install instructions](/docs/distributing-an-application/installing-manually/).

For detailed requirements and installation guides see the docker installation docs.
