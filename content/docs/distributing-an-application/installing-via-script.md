We provide an easy-to-use one-line installation process (via shell script) which will detect your OS, ask a few questions and install both docker-engine and the required Replicated components.

If you want to always release your application with a specific version of Replicated you can read how to [always install a specific version of Replicated](/docs/kb/supporting-your-customers/install-known-versions/).

{{< linked_headline "Basic Install" >}}

Save the install script to file and run. We recommend reading and understanding the install script prior to running.

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh https://get.replicated.com/docker
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

Quick install

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash
```

{{< linked_headline "Release Channel Install Scripts" >}}

Every release channel for your application has a custom install link. Using the channel install link allows the Replicated installer will optimize the install process. Based on your app YAML the installer will choose the highest allowed version of Replicated using your configured [replicated_version](/docs/packaging-an-application/preflight-checks/) range.

To find the install link, login to your [vendor.replicated.com](https://vendor.replicated.com/) account, select your app and click "build history" for your channel and click "Copy install script url".

{{< linked_headline "Flags" >}}

The install script takes optional flags to configure Replicated for your environment.

| Flag                          | Usage                                                                                              |

Example call with flags:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash -s no-auto ui-bind-port=8000
```

{{< note title="Best practices with the easy-install script" >}}
When you're ready to start shipping to customers we recommend that you proxy this install script with a TLS cert matching your domain name. The script should always be served with TLS.
{{< /note >}}

{{< linked_headline "Installing Behind A Proxy" >}}

The Replicated installation script supports environments where an HTTP proxy server is required to access the Internet. The installation script will prompt for the proxy address and will set up Replicated and Docker to use the supplied value.

An example of running the Replicated installation script with a proxy server is:

```shell
curl -x http://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port> https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash
```

# Post-Installation Maintenance

{{< linked_headline "Upgrade to latest Replicated build" >}}

If you would like to upgrade Replicated to the latest release simply [rerun the installation script](/docs/distributing-an-application/installing-via-script/) and that will upgrade the Replicated components to the latest build.

{{< linked_headline "Restarting Replicated" >}}

If you installed Replicated using the easy installation script, the script will have created an init service you can use to control Replicated. In this case, restarting replicated varies depending on your host OS.

### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
service replicated restart
service replicated-ui restart
service replicated-operator restart
```

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

```shell
sudo systemctl restart replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
```

{{< linked_headline "Removing Replicated" >}}

To remove Replicated run the following script:

### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
service replicated stop
service replicated-ui stop
service replicated-operator stop
docker stop replicated-premkit
docker stop replicated-statsd
docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd
docker images | grep "quay\.io/replicated" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs sudo docker rmi -f
apt-get remove -y replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
apt-get purge -y replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
rm -rf /var/lib/replicated* /etc/replicated* /etc/init/replicated* /etc/init.d/replicated* /etc/default/replicated* /var/log/upstart/replicated* /etc/systemd/system/replicated*
docker rm -f `sudo docker ps -aq`
docker rmi  `sudo docker images -q`
```

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

```shell
systemctl stop replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
service replicated stop
service replicated-ui stop
service replicated-operator stop
docker stop replicated-premkit
docker stop replicated-statsd
docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd
docker images | grep "quay\.io/replicated" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs sudo docker rmi -f
yum remove -y replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
rm -rf /var/lib/replicated* /etc/replicated* /etc/init/replicated* /etc/default/replicated* /etc/systemd/system/replicated* /etc/sysconfig/replicated* /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/replicated* /run/replicated*
docker rm -f `sudo docker ps -aq`
docker rmi  `sudo docker images -q`
```
