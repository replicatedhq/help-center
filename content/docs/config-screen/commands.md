The `cmds` section of the YAML allows you to leverage the power of external commands within your configuration.
The sole purpose of these `cmds` is to generate data for input in the configuration screen.

A command takes a variable number of string arguments and returns an array of strings.
We have created an API with some useful commands.
There is also the option to run the command raw.
This command will take any `raw` string input and run the command in an [Ubuntu Trusty container](https://hub.docker.com/r/replicated/cmd/).

The command is run at YAML import time only (during app installation & during app updates).
Data imported with `value_cmd` or `data_cmd` will not be overwritten upon updating the app, but `default_cmd` will.
(For all three import methods the command is rerun during app update, but the results will only be used to overwrite prior values in the case of `default_cmd`)
Modifying the name of a config item will cause it to be recognized as a new item and a new value will be generated.

Below is an example of a command that will generate a private key, a x509 certificate, and a random admin password that are used as configuration for our app.

```yaml
cmds:
- name: cert_cmd_result
  cmd: cert
  args:
  - "1024"
- name: gen_secret_result
  cmd: random
  args:
  - "32"
```

```yaml
config:
- name: keys
  title: Generated Internal Certificates, Keys and Passwords
  items:
  - name: server_private_key
    title: Private key file
    type: file
    hidden: true
    data_cmd:
      name: cert_cmd_result
      value_at: 0
  - name: server_cert
    title: Certificate file
    type: file
    hidden: true
    data_cmd:
      name: cert_cmd_result
      value_at: 1
  - name: server_authority
    title: X.509 Signing Authority
    type: file
    hidden: true
    data_cmd:
      name: cert_cmd_result
      value_at: 2
  - name: admin_password
    title: Generated Admin Password
    type: text
    value_cmd:
      name: gen_secret_result
      value_at: 0
```

# Available Commands
{{< linked_headline "cert" >}}

Generates a private key and x509 certificate pair. The resulting certificate is signed by the certificate authority belonging to the local instance of the Replicated management container. The authority certificate is also returned by this command so that clients can verify the full X.509 chain.

*Note 1*: The authority certificate is generated the first time the management container is run on a system.

*Note 2*: If you do not pass-in your own domain or IP address values to this command, you'll need to make sure that your server is set up to ignore bad certificate chains.

*Note 2 (long explanation)*: To properly verify the resulting certificate chain, the server using this new certificate must be accessible via the domains or the IP addresses encoded into the cert. You can specify these values as arguments to the cert command. If you don't, default values will be used, and the defaults will almost certainly not match the domain or IP address of the actual machine using the cert.

### Arguments
- Key length: The length in bits of the private key. Default: 1024
- Domains: Comma-separated list of domains for which this certificate is valid. Default: "example.com"
- IP addresses: Comma-separated list of IP addresses for which this certificate is valid. Default: the IP address bound to eth0 on the machine running the Replicated management container.

### Return value
- 0: The new PEM-encoded private key.
- 1: The new PEM-encoded certificate.
- 2: The PEM-encoded cert authority used to sign the new certificate.

```yaml
cmds:
- name: cert_cmd_result
  cmd: cert
  args:
  - "4096"
  - mycounterapp.com
```

{{< linked_headline "publicip" >}}

Gets the public IP address of the agent server.

This function reaches out to an external service to acquire the ip and the result can then be written to a config item.

### Return value
- 0: Public IP address

```yaml
- name: host_ip
  cmd: publicip
  args: []
```

{{< linked_headline "random" >}}

Generates a random string with the default charset [_A-Za-z0-9].

### Arguments
- Length - The length of the string (default 16 characters).
- Charset

### Return value
- 0: Random string

```yaml
- name: hash_key
  cmd: random
  args:
  - "64"
  - "[A-Za-z0-9]"
```

{{< linked_headline "echo" >}}

Echos the first argument.

### Arguments
- String to echo

### Return value
- 0: String

```yaml
- name: hello_world
  cmd: echo
  args:
  - Hello World!
```

{{< linked_headline "raw" >}}

Runs command from a bash shell inside an "ubuntu:trusty" docker container. The docker image is hosted on dockerhub at https://hub.docker.com/r/freighter/cmd/

### Arguments
- Variable

### Return value
- 0: String

```yaml
- name: hello_world
  cmd: raw
  args:
  - echo
  - Hello World!
```


# Example Usage
{{< linked_headline "persistent password" >}}

This example generates a 64 character password for use with a database that will be held constant across updates.
A checkbox is also used to allow the customer to view this password, but not edit it.
A second checkbox allows the customer to edit the password.

```yaml
cmds:
- name: gen_db_password
  cmd: random
  args:
  - "64"

config:
- name: generated
  title: Generated Internal Passwords
  items:
  # the db_password_init item should not be used by anything besides db_password_persist
  - type: password
    name: db_password_init
    hidden: true
    value_cmd:
      name: gen_db_password
      value_at: 0

  - type: password
    name: db_password_persist
    title: Persistent DB Password
    value: '{{repl ConfigOption "db_password_init"}}'
    when: edit_switch=1

  - type: text
    name: db_password_view
    title: "Persistent DB Password"
    readonly: true
    value: '{{repl ConfigOption "db_password_persist"}}'
    when: view_switch=1

  - name: view_switch
    title: View Internal Passwords
    type: bool
    value: 0
    affix: left

  - name: edit_switch
    title: Edit Internal Passwords
    type: bool
    value: 0
    affix: right

```
