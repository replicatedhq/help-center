The Replicated [easy install script](/docs/native/customer-installations/installing-via-script/) provides several configuration options for working with an HTTP proxy.
Passing the `no-proxy` flag to the install script will disable all proxy discovery and configuration.

## Proxy Discovery

Replicated attempts to discover an HTTP proxy by checking the following environment variables in sequence:

* HTTP_PROXY
* http_proxy
* HTTPS_PROXY
* https_proxy

If none of these is set, Replicated will prompt the user to enter a proxy address or confirm that no proxy is required.

## Proxy Configuration

If a proxy address is discovered or set, Replicated will assemble a default list of NO_PROXY addresses including localhost, the address of the `docker0` interface, and the address of the server running the Replicated daemon. Additional addresses can be added with the `additional-no-proxy` parameter, which can be specified multiple times.
Note that this parameter does not accept an IP range in CIDR notation.

```bash
cat install.sh | sudo bash -s additional-no-proxy=corporate.internal additional-no-proxy=10.128.0.9
```

To prevent errors during image pulls, Replicated will add the `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to docker and restart it.

The installer will configure the Replicated daemon and operator containers to run with the `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` variables set in the environment.
Replicated will respect these adresses when running application [ready state checks](/docs/native/packaging-an-application/starting-and-stopping/#ready-state).

Replicated will add the `no_proxy` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to all application containers.
It will not add the `HTTP_PROXY` to any application container automatically.
Use the [ConsoleSetting](/docs/native/packaging-an-application/template-functions/#consolesetting) template function to add `HTTP_PROXY` to the environment of any of your application containers.
```yaml
        env_vars:
          - name: HTTP_PROXY
            value: {{repl ConsoleSetting "http.proxy"}}
            when: {{repl ConsoleSettingEquals "http.proxy.enabled" "1"}}
```
