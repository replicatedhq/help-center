An "airgapped" environment is a network that has no path to inbound or outbound internet traffic at all. Some enterprise customers require that you ship a package they can install in their airgapped environment.

Replicated supports this type of installation, using the following steps:

{{< linked_headline "Prepare the environment" >}}

The customer will be responsible for delivering a server running a supported version of Docker. Replicated
supports Docker from {{< docker_version_minimum >}} to {{< docker_version_default >}}. We recommend that you use the latest version of Docker available in this range for your operating system.

The Replicated airgap installation script does not install docker-engine. We've written a guide with some tips that might help get [Docker installed into air gapped machines](/docs/kb/supporting-your-customers/installing-docker-in-airgapped/) with various operating systems.

{{< linked_headline "Install Replicated" >}}

Replicated can be installed by downloading the latest release from https://s3.amazonaws.com/replicated-airgap-work/replicated.tar.gz and running the following commands:

```shell
tar xzvf replicated.tar.gz
cat ./install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap
```

{{< linked_headline "Download Airgap Package" >}}

On the license properties page in the vendor portal, enable Airgap installations for this license and copy the download link. This URL is designed to be delivered to that customer. They will use this link to download current airgap packages when you promote a release. When they download new airgap packages to their server, it is important that your customer set the `--trust-server-names` and `--content-disposition` flags for `wget` or rename the file to something ending with `.airgap`.

Your customer will need the `.airgap` package and the normal Replicated license (.rli) file. Be sure to download the license file *after* enabling the airgap feature on the license. Airgap-enabled licenses have more metadata embedded than non-airgap licenses. Airgap enabled licenses can be used to install in non-airgap mode, but non-airgap licenses cannot be used to install in airgap mode.

Next, navigate to the Admin Console at https://\<server_ip\>:8800. Accept the self signed certificate, pass the preflight checks, and you will see the license upload screen. Upload the [airgap enabled license](/docs/native/getting-started/create-licenses/#airgap-download-enabled) and then select the airgapped install option. You will have to provide a path to the .airgap file and upload the .rli file here.

Once this screen is completed, Replicated runs as normal. In the Admin Console Settings page (/console/settings), there is a section to set the Airgap properties. You can install updates and sync the license by downloading new versions of these, renaming them with the .airgap extension and placing them in the locations specified on the /console/settings page.

{{< linked_headline "Adding Additional Nodes" >}}

In order to add additional nodes to your cluster, just navigate to the Cluster page of the Admin Console, click the "Add Node" button, and follow the instructions there. For more detailed instructions see the [add nodes](/docs/native/packaging-an-application/add-nodes/) page of the docs.
