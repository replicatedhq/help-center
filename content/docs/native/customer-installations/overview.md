Once your application is [packaged](/docs/native/packaging-an-application/overview), it is time to distribute it to your customers. This section provides all of the information necessary to setup and manage customer installations. If you need help installing Replicated, help is available through the [Replicated community](https://help.replicated.com/community/) or via email at [contact@replicated.com](mailto:contact@replicated.com).

The [Installing](/docs/native/customer-installations/installing) documentation contains all of the documentation needed to install Replicated with the easy install script, manually, or as an airgapped install.

The [Automating](/docs/native/customer-installations/automating) documentation provides information about completely automated installs, which are useful for both continuous integration and customers wanting to completely automate the provisioning and setup of your application.

For multi-node installations, the [Adding Nodes](/docs/native/customer-installations/add-nodes) documentation is a resource for adding more nodes to your Replicated installation.
