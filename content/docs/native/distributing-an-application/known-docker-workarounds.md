## Overlay driver enabled despite being on an unsupported configuration
The default driver chosen by some Docker versions on RHEL and CentOS, `overlay`, has [requirements](https://docs.docker.com/v17.06/engine/userguide/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/) that are not always satisfied. On Docker 17.06.2-ce, `overlay` and `overlay2` require kernels >= 3.18 and 4.0, respectively. Also, xfs filesystems must have been created with `d_type=true`, which can be verified by using `xfs_info` and searching for `ftype=1`. If these requirements are not met, we recommend specifying a different storage driver. The `devicemapper` storage driver may be enabled for production by following the [Docker Device Mapper Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#configure-direct-lvm-mode-for-production).

## Docker 17.12.0-ce on CentOS and RHEL does not install all needed dependencies
On CentOS and RHEL, a needed dependency of `libseccomp >= 2.2.1` is not enforced. This is present on 7.4, but not 7.3 or earlier. This can be remedied by running 
```shell
yum install http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/libseccomp-2.3.1-3.el7.x86_64.rpm
```
 as per the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35906).

## Docker 17.06.0-ce requires container-selinux >= 2.9 on RHEL
Installing the CentOS `container-selinux` package and rerunning the Replicated installation script resolves this. The latest version of the package can be found [here](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/). As of the 11th of January 2018 this command installed the latest version available:
```shell
yum install http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/container-selinux-2.33-1.git86f33cd.el7.noarch.rpm
```
