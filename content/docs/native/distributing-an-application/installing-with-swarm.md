We distribute an installation script that can be used to install Replicated into a new or existing Swarm cluster. The cluster does not have to be created at this point, the Replicated install script can install Docker Engine and provision a new Swarm cluster.

{{< note title="Swarm YAML Required" >}}
The Swarm scheduler requires a new YAML format as discussed here: [Replicated with Docker Swarm](/docs/packaging-an-application/docker-swarm/). Only one scheduler, Replicated or Swarm, can be used in any given installation and switching between schedulers is not supported.
{{< /note >}}

{{< linked_headline "Basic install (recommended):" >}}

The basic install will install Docker (as needed) and Replicated. It will save the install script to a file which you can inspect and then run. We recommend reading and understanding the install script prior to running.

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh  https://get.replicated.com/swarm-init
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

{{< linked_headline "Quick Install:" >}}

The quick Swarm install will install Docker (as needed) and Replicated. Use this method if you have no need to view/change the installer script and you just want a one-line install.

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/swarm-init | sudo bash
```

{{< linked_headline "Flags:" >}}

The install script can take flags to help your customers with specialized enterprise setups.

| Flag                          | Usage                                                                                              |

Example quick install with flags:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/swarm-init | sudo bash -s no-proxy ui-bind-port=8000
```

{{< linked_headline "Advanced Install" >}}

The advanced Swarm install requires the host is running Docker with a version between {{< swarm_docker_version_minimum >}} - {{< swarm_docker_version_default >}}.

This method will save the Docker Compose YAML to a file and then run a command using the YAML file as the input. We recommend reading and understanding the Compose file prior to running.

```shell
docker swarm init
curl -sSL -o docker-compose.yml "https://get.replicated.com/docker-compose.yml?swarm_node_address=$(docker info --format '{{.Swarm.NodeAddr}}')"
docker node update --label-add replicated-role=master "$(docker info --format '{{.Swarm.NodeID}}')"
export LC_CTYPE=C;echo "$(head -c 128 /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)" | docker secret create daemon_token -
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml replicated
```

{{< linked_headline "Installing Behind a Proxy" >}}

Proxy support for Swarm will be included in a future release of Replicated.

{{< linked_headline "Uninstall Entire Swarm Stack" >}}

To remove the entire Swarm stack run the following script.
{{< warning title="Swarm Uninstall Warning" >}}
This will remove everything including images, volumes, secrets, etc.. Don't do this unless you are planning on completely starting over.
{{< /warning >}}

```
docker stack ls | grep replicated_ | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker stack rm
sleep 5; docker service rm premkit_replicated
sleep 5; docker service rm statsd_replicated
sleep 5; docker volume rm replicated-premkit-data-volume
sleep 5; docker volume ls | grep statsd | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
sleep 5; docker network rm statsd_replicated premkit_replicated
sleep 5; docker stack rm replicated
sleep 5; docker ps -a | grep piper | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
sleep 10; docker volume ls | grep replicated | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
sleep 5; docker images | grep 'replicated\|premkit' | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
sleep 5; docker secret ls | grep 'replicated\daemon_token' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker secret rm
sleep 5; docker stack rm retraced
```
