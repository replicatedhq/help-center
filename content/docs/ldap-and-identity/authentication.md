{{<legacynotice>}}

One feature of the Replicated LDAP integration is the ability for your application containers to authenticate using a simple REST API that runs inside your application environment. When your application container creates an authentication request against the on-prem Replicated API, Replicated will send the request to the identity provider for login and return a success/error response synchronously.

For details on using the Identity API in your application, refer to the [Identity API](/api/integration-api/identity-api/) reference documentation.
