In addition to authentication, Replicated can sync a directory (or a subset of a directory) to your application. This is useful when your application needs to know the list of all users and expects them to be in a users table in the database.

To sync users from a corporate identity provider, you can use the Replicated Provisioning API, which is available in the context of your application when running behind the firewall. For details, refer to the [Provisioning API reference](/api/integration-api/provisioning-api/).
