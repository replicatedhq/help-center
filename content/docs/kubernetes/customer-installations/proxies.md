The Replicated [install script](/docs/kubernetes/customer-installations/installing/) provides several configuration options for working with an HTTP proxy. 
Passing either the `airgap` or `no-proxy` flags to the install script will disable all proxy discovery and configuration.

## Proxy Discovery

Replicated attempts to discover an HTTP proxy by checking the following environment variables in sequence:

* HTTP_PROXY
* http_proxy
* HTTPS_PROXY
* https_proxy
 
If none of these is set, Replicated will prompt the user to enter a proxy address or confirm that no proxy is required.

## Proxy Configuration

If a proxy address is discovered or set, Replicated will assemble a default list of NO_PROXY addresses including localhost, the address of the `docker0` interface, and the address of the server running the Replicated daemon. Additional addresses can be added with the `additional-no-proxy` parameter, which can be specified multiple times.
Note that this parameter does not accept an IP range in CIDR notation.

```bash
cat kubernetes-init.sh | sudo bash -s additional-no-proxy=corporate.internal additional-no-proxy=10.128.0.9
```

To prevent errors during image pulls, Replicated will add the `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to docker and restart it.

The installer will configure the Replicated deployment to run with the `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` variables set in the environment.

Replicated will not add the `HTTP_PROXY` or `NO_PROXY` environment variables to any application pods automatically.
Use the [ConsoleSetting](/docs/kubernetes/packaging-an-application/template-functions/#consolesetting) template function to add `HTTP_PROXY` to the environment of any of your application pods.
```yaml
env:
  - name: HTTP_PROXY
    value: {{repl ConsoleSetting "http.proxy"}}
```
