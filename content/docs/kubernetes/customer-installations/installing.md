We distribute an installation script that can be used to install Docker, Kubernetes and Replicated. The cluster should not be created prior to running the install script. The Replicated install script will install a working Kubernetes cluster.

{{< linked_headline "Basic install (recommended):" >}}

The basic install will install Docker, Kubernetes and Replicated. It will save the install script to a file which you can inspect and then run. We recommend reading and understanding the install script prior to running.

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh  https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

{{< linked_headline "Quick Install" >}}

The quick Kubernetes install will install Docker, Kubernetes and Replicated. Use this method if you have no need to view/change the installer script and you just want a one-line install.

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init | sudo bash
```

{{< linked_headline "Flags" >}}

The install script can take flags to help your customers with specialized enterprise setups.

Example quick install with flags:

```

{{< linked_headline "Compatible Kubernetes Versions" >}}

Every release of Replicated is pinned to a version of Kubernetes, which will be installed by the install script.

| Replicated Version | Kubernetes Version |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| < 2.26.0           | 1.9.3              |
| 2.26.0 to 2.30.2   | 1.11.5             |
| >= 2.31.0          | 1.13.0             |

Replicated 2.26.0 to 2.30.2 were pinned to Kubernetes 1.11.1 when released but were updated on December 7, 2018 to 1.11.5.
Re-running the `kubernetes-init` install script will not update 1.11.1 installs to 1.11.5 by default, but the upgrade can be forced by passing the `kubernetes-upgrade-patch-version` flag to the script.

{{< linked_headline "Upgrading" >}}

Please refer to our docs on upgrading [here](../upgrading)

{{< linked_headline "High Availability" >}}

Replicated Embedded Kubernetes has the ability to run in highly available mode with multiple Kubernetes master control plane nodes. The addition of the `ha` flag when running the Kubernetes easy-install script signals to Replicated that this cluster should be run in HA mode. For more information please refer to our docs on high availability clusters [here](../high-availability).

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh  https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init
sudo bash ./install.sh ha
```

{{< linked_headline "Uninstalling" >}}

Use the `reset` flag to uninstall Kubernetes and Replicated.  Please note that this flag is not recommended to be used on production systems.

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init | sudo bash -s reset
```

The procedure described in [this post](https://help.replicated.com/community/t/uninstall-a-kubernetes-replicated-application/295) can be used to reset Replicated back to the state where license can be uploaded again without removing Kubernetes.  This is a safer option.
