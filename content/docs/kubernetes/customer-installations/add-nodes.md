When an application is configured by the vendor with a clustering strategy, Replicated makes it possible for the end customer to install additional nodes on remote instances to run a distributed application.

On the Cluster page on the On-Prem Console an "Add Node" button will be visible. This will prompt the end customer with an option for adding a node.

Additionally, the node join script can be generated using the CLI command `replicatedctl cluster node-join-script`. For more information please refer to the documentation [here](https://help.replicated.com/api/replicatedctl/replicatedctl_cluster_node-join-script/).

The join script will add Docker and all dependencies for a worker node in a Kubernetes cluster, then join the cluster through the master node.
