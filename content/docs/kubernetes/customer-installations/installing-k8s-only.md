The Replicated installation script can be used to install Docker and Kubernetes in an airgapped environment, and not install Replicated to the cluster. This is useful when you want to use another method to distribute your application, such as [The Getting Started Guide](/guides/kubernetes-with-ship/).

{{< linked_headline "Basic install (recommended):" >}}

The basic install will install Docker, Kubernetes by pulling the scripts and resources from the Internet. It will save the install script to a file which you can inspect and then run. We recommend reading and understanding the install script prior to running.

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh  https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init
sudo bash ./install.sh -s kubernetes-only
```

{{< linked_headline "Quick Install" >}}

The quick Kubernetes install will install Docker, Kubernetes and Replicated. Use this method if you have no need to view/change the installer script and you just want a one-line install.

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/kubernetes-init | sudo bash -s kubernetes-only
```

{{< linked_headline "Flags" >}}

The install script can take flags to help your customers with specialized enterprise setups.

{{< linked_headline "Kubernetes Only In Airgapped Environments ">}}

The airgap package can be installed by downloading the latest release from https://s3.amazonaws.com/replicated-airgap-work/replicated__docker__kubernetes.tar.gz and running the following commands:


```shell
tar xzvf replicated__docker__kubernetes.tar.gz
cat ./kubernetes-init.sh | sudo bash -s airgap kubernetes-only
```
