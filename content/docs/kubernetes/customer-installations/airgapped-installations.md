An "airgapped" environment is a network that has no path to inbound or outbound internet traffic at all. Some enterprise customers require that you ship a package they can install in their airgapped environment.

Replicated supports this type of installation, using the following steps:

{{< linked_headline "Prepare the environment" >}}

The customer will be responsible for delivering a server that is capable of running Replicated, Kubernetes and Docker. Refer to the [supporting operating systems](../supported-operating-systems) list for a list of officially supported systems.

The Replicated airgap installation script for Kubernetes will install docker-engine, Kubernetes and all necessary dependencies.

{{< linked_headline "Install Replicated" >}}

Replicated can be installed by downloading the latest release from https://s3.amazonaws.com/replicated-airgap-work/replicated__docker__kubernetes.tar.gz and running the following commands:

```shell
tar xzvf replicated__docker__kubernetes.tar.gz
cat ./kubernetes-init.sh | sudo bash -s airgap
```

On the license properties page in the vendor portal, enable Airgap installations for this license and copy the download link. This URL is designed to be delivered to that customer. They will use this link to download
current airgap packages when you promote a release. When they download new airgap packages to their server, it is important that your customer set the `--trust-server-names` and `--content-disposition` flags for `wget` or rename the file to something ending with `.airgap`.

Your customer will need the `.airgap` package and the normal Replicated license (.rli) file. Be sure to download the license file *after* enabling the airgap feature on the license. Airgap-enabled licenses have more metadata embedded than non-airgap licenses. Airgap enabled licenses can be used to install in non-airgap mode, but non-airgap licenses cannot be used to install in airgap mode.

Next, navigate to the management console at https://\<server_ip\>:8800. Accept the self signed certificate, pass the preflight checks, and you will see the license upload screen. Upload the [airgap enabled license](/docs/kubernetes/getting-started/create-licenses/#airgap-download-enabled) and then select the airgapped install option. You will have to provide a path to the .airgap file and upload the .rli file here.

Once this screen is completed, Replicated runs as normal. In the :8800/console/settings page, there is a section to set the Airgap mode settings. You can install updates and sync the license by downloading new versions of these, renaming them with the .airgap extension and placing them in the locations specified on the /console/settings page.
