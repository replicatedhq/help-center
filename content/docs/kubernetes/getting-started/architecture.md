The Replicated Kubernetes installer builds on [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/), adding support for Pod networking, relocatable Persistent Volumes, and Ingress.

## Core Components
Replicated's install script will first install Docker and a few binaries on the host: `kubelet`, `kubeadm`, and `kubectl`.
The `kubelet` binary runs as a systemd service, while `kubeadm` and `kubectl` commands are run manually.
Replicated then delegates to `kubeadm init` to bootstrap the cluster.
All system services besides `kubelet` run as pods in the `kube-system` namespace, including the Kubernetes API Server, Kube Proxy, Etcd, Kube Controller Manager, the Kube Scheduler, and CoreDNS.

## Networking

Replicated adds a Weave DaemonSet to the `kube-system` namespace to provide pod networking on every node in the cluster.
Weave places a binary in `/opt/cni/bin` that fulfills the [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#cni) interface, which ensures that every pod is assigned an IP address that is routeable across the cluster.
The Weave DaemonSet includes a Network Policy Controller to support [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) resources in the cluster.
All traffic between hosts is [encrypted by default](/docs/kubernetes/customer-installations/networking/#encryption).

## Storage

Replicated installs the [Rook Operator](https://rook.io/) in the `rook-ceph-system` namespace, which manages the ceph storage system.
Replicated creates a Ceph cluster by creating a [Cluster](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.0/ceph-cluster-crd.html) config in the `rook-ceph` namespace and configures the cluster to use the `/opt/replicated/rook` directory on all nodes automatically.
A [Pool](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.0/ceph-pool-crd.html) is created to provide block storage backed by the cluster for PersistentVolumeClaims.
Replicated will automatically increase the replication level of this Pool as nodes are added to the cluster, up to a maximum replication factor of 3.

Previous versions of Replicated were bundled with [Rook version 0.8](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/v0.8/).
When upgrading Replicated the Rook Operator will not be upgraded to the current version.
Manual steps can be followed using [this guide](/docs/kubernetes/customer-installations/upgrading-rook/).

## Ingress

Replicated adds a [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour) [ingress controller](/docs/kubernetes/packaging-an-application/ingress/) to the `heptio-contour` namespace. This controller listens on ports 80 and 443 of every node.

## Replicated

After a Kubernetes cluster has been brought up, a Deployment is created in the default namespace for Replicated. When a license is uploaded, Replicated will generate a namespace for the application and apply the release yaml to it. There are three cases in which Replicated will directly modify application config yaml:

1. If running in airgap mode, all Pod images will be rewritten to pull from the registry running in the Replicated daemon pod.
1. If a pod mounts a Persistent Volume that is included in snapshots, Replicated will add a sidecar to the pod to backup the contents.
1. All PersistentVolumeClaims will receive the `storageClassName` property to ensure they are automatically provisioned by Rook.
1. All Deployments, ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers and StatefulSets without the `replicas` property explicitly set will implicitly scale to 1 replica when started.
