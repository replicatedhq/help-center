Replicated is capable of auto-upgrading itself to any version that is [pinned to the same version of Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/customer-installations/installing/#compatible-kubernetes-versions).
Set the `replicated_version` in the `host_requirements` section of your Replicated yaml to a range to enable this feature.

```yaml
host_requirements:
  replicated_version: "<=2.26.0"
```

If configured, Replicated will attempt to auto-upgrade itself every time your app is updated to a new version.
This feature is not enabled on airgap installs.
