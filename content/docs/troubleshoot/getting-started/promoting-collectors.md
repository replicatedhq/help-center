# Promoting Troubleshoot Collectors

Troubleshoot Custom Collectors are versioned and released with your application. They use the same release channels, and can be promoted at the same time as an application release. This gives you the ability to include debugging and troubleshooting data specific to each release of your application.

Additionally, updates to the custom collectors can be released without requiring a new application version to be promoted. The version of custom collectors on a release can be changed at any time.

### Promoting Custom Collectors

To promote a set of custom collectors to a release channel, visit the [Customer Collectors page](https://vendor.replicated.com/troubleshoot/collectors) in the Vendor Portal.
