# Promoting Troubleshoot Analyzers

Troubleshoot Custom Analyzers are versioned and released with your application. They use the same release channels, and can be promoted at the same time as an application release. This gives you the ability to analyze debugging and troubleshooting data specific to each release of your application.

Additionally, updates to the custom analyzers can be released without requiring a new application version to be promoted. The version of custom analyzers on a release can be changed at any time.

### Promoting Custom Analyzers

To promote a set of custom analyzers to a release channel, visit the [Customer Analyzers page](https://vendor.replicated.com/troubleshoot/analyzers) in the Vendor Portal.
