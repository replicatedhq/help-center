# Docker Storage Drivers

Not every docker storage driver is compatible with each kernel version, and some storage drivers have additional configuration that is required or recommended to run in a production environment. For example, running a server with the devicemapper storage driver in loopback mode is ok for a test environment or locally, but not recommended in a production setup.

When a server is running with an improperly configuraed storage driver, it might be ok for some time, and start to experience problems at load or after a specific number of containers are running.

The support bundle analyzers look for known incompatible or not-recommended storage driver settings and will report these as errors when detected.
