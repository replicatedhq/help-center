Both Troubleshoot and Preflight are built and packaged to be run by the cluster administrator, with no knowledge of the application.

## Preflight Checks

Preflight Checks are designed to be run before the application is installed. There are no in-cluster prerequisites, but there's a client side kubectl plugin that's required. To install the preflight client-side functionality, run `kubectl krew install preflight`. For instructions on how to get krew or for additional installation options, see the [Running Preflights](/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/preflight/executing/) document.

Once the plugin is installed, you can run a set of sample Preflight Checks with:

```shell
kubectl preflight https://preflight.replicated.com
```

## Support Bundles

Support Bundles are designed to be run when something is wrong with an application. There are no in-cluster prerequisites, but again, there's a client side kubectl plugin that's required. To install, run `kubectl krew install troubleshoot`. For instructions on how to get krew or for additional installation options, see the [Collecting Support Bundles](/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/preflight/executing/) document.

Once the plugin is installed, you can generate a sample Support Bundle with:

```shell
kubectl support-bundle https://support-bundle.replicated.com
```
