Replicated Troubleshoot is a collection of utilities that can be used for preflight checks and remotely diagnosing a server.

## Kubernetes Apps
Our [Kubernetes Troubleshoot](/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/getting-started/overview/) is designed to run [preflight checks](/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/preflight/overview/) and generate [support bundles](/docs/troubleshoot/kubernetes/support-bundle/overview/) to assist with environment conformance testing and post-installation diagnostics. Choose this option if you plan to install a Kubernetes application into an existing cluster.


## Server Troubleshoot
Our [Server Troubleshoot](/docs/troubleshoot/server/getting-started/overview/) is designed to debug a full server environment, including networking, Linux settings, Replicated installations and Kubernetes itself. Choose this option if you are trying to diagnose a a VM or an Appliance running Kubernetes.
