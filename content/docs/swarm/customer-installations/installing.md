We distribute an installation script that can be used to install Replicated into a new or existing Swarm cluster. The cluster does not have to be created at this point, the Replicated install script can install Docker Engine and provision a new Swarm cluster.

{{< linked_headline "Basic install (recommended):" >}}

The basic install will install Docker (as needed) and Replicated. It will save the install script to a file which you can inspect and then run. We recommend reading and understanding the install script prior to running.

```shell
curl -sSL -o install.sh  https://get.replicated.com/swarm-init
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

{{< linked_headline "Quick Install:" >}}

The quick Swarm install will install Docker (as needed) and Replicated. Use this method if you have no need to view/change the installer script and you just want a one-line install.

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/swarm-init | sudo bash
```

{{< linked_headline "Flags:" >}}

The install script can take flags to help your customers with specialized enterprise setups.

{{< linked_headline "Advanced Install" >}}

The advanced Swarm install requires the host is running Docker with a version between {{< swarm_docker_version_minimum >}} - {{< swarm_docker_version_default >}}.

This method will save the Docker Compose YAML to a file and then run a command using the YAML file as the input. We recommend reading and understanding the Compose file prior to running.

```shell
docker swarm init
curl -sSL -o docker-compose.yml "https://get.replicated.com/docker-compose.yml?swarm_node_address=$(docker info --format '{{.Swarm.NodeAddr}}')"
docker node update --label-add replicated-role=master "$(docker info --format '{{.Swarm.NodeID}}')"
export LC_CTYPE=C;echo "$(head -c 128 /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)" | docker secret create daemon_token -
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml replicated
```

{{< linked_headline "Customizing Overlay Networks" >}}

Replicated requires four overlay networks in addition to any overlay networks required by your app.
By default Swarm assigns a /24 subnet from the 10.0.0.0/8 global subnet to each overlay network.
This may interfere with a customer's existing networks.
Use the `exclude-subnet` param to exclude multiple /16 subnets from the 10.0.0.0/8 default subnet.

Customers that need to exclude the entire 10.0.0.0/8 will need to create all networks in advance with assigned subnets.
Create the following networks before installing Replicated, modifying the subnets for the host:

```shell
SUBNET_1=172.20.0.0/16
SUBNET_2=172.21.0.0/16
SUBNET_3=172.22.0.0/16
SUBNET_4=172.23.0.0/16

docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=$SUBNET_1 --label=com.docker.stack.namespace=replicated replicated_default
docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=$SUBNET_2 --label=com.docker.stack.namespace=retraced retraced_default
docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=$SUBNET_3 --label=PremkitReplicatedNamespace=replicated premkit_replicated
docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=$SUBNET_4 --label=StatsdReplicatedNamespace=replicated statsd_replicated
```

Then install Replicated and your app. Swarm will create the network(s) for your app in the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet.
Run `docker stack ls` to find your application namespace, which will vary for every install.
In the following results `repl5397a011` is the application namespace.

```shell
NAME                SERVICES
repl5397a011        8
replicated          3
retraced            8
```

Run `docker network ls` to find networks in the application namespace.
In the following results `repl5397a011_voteapp` is an application network.

```shell
NETWORK ID          NAME                   DRIVER              SCOPE
ea5f9efd3242        bridge                 bridge              local
3972c6a9cb30        docker_gwbridge        bridge              local
fcc8f63af47a        host                   host                local
k1m7wagciv3h        ingress                overlay             swarm
eeee239be18e        none                   null                local
se30g4p6s8oc        premkit_replicated     overlay             swarm
obu0vkl7u54k        repl5397a011_voteapp   overlay             swarm
2enrenhp40cu        replicated_default     overlay             swarm
dvj7lqoj6j2r        retraced_default       overlay             swarm
spajlqj8i144        statsd_replicated      overlay             swarm
```

Run `docker network inspect <network>` for each application network and note the Labels:

```shell
docker network inspect repl5397a011_voteapp
...
	"Labels": {
		"com.docker.stack.namespace": "repl5397a011"
	},
...
```

Stop the app in the Replicated UI or with the Replicated CLI.
Then run `docker stack rm repl5397a011` to remove your app if the namespace is `repl5397a011'.

Manually create all the required application networks following the pattern above:

```shell
SUBNET_5=172.24.0.0/16

docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=$SUBNET_5 --label=com.docker.stack.namespace=repl5397a011 repl5397a011_voteapp
```

Finally, restart your app with the Replicated UI or CLI.

{{< linked_headline "Uninstall Entire Swarm Stack" >}}

To remove the entire Swarm stack run the following script.
{{< warning title="Swarm Uninstall Warning" >}}
This will remove everything including images, volumes, secrets, etc.. Don't do this unless you are planning on completely starting over.
{{< /warning >}}

```
docker stack ls | grep replicated_ | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker stack rm
sleep 5; docker service rm premkit_replicated
sleep 5; docker service rm statsd_replicated
sleep 5; docker volume rm replicated-premkit-data-volume
sleep 5; docker volume ls | grep statsd | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
sleep 5; docker network rm statsd_replicated premkit_replicated
sleep 5; docker stack rm replicated
sleep 5; docker ps -a | grep piper | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
sleep 10; docker volume ls | grep replicated | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
sleep 5; docker images | grep 'replicated\|premkit' | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
sleep 5; docker secret ls | grep 'replicated\daemon_token' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker secret rm
sleep 5; docker stack rm retraced
```

{{< linked_headline "Security Groups and Firewalls" >}}

To ensure that overlay networking is available in Docker Swarm, make sure the following ports are open between all nodes that act as Swarm nodes:

* TCP port 2377 for cluster management
* TCP and UDP port 7946 for general communication
* UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

For more information about overlay networking in Docker Swarm, see the [Docker Swarm overlay networking documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/).
