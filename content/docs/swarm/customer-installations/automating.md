Replicated has support for automated installation and configuration. This feature is built for bootstrapping new installations and not for managing existing installations.

These steps must be run before installing Replicated. Replicated will only check for these
values during initial installation.

## Configure Replicated Automatically

During installation, Replicated will check for a config file at `/etc/replicated.conf`. To configure Replicated, create this file before installation, using any or all of the following options:

```json
{
  "BypassPreflightChecks": true,
  "DaemonAuthenticationType": "password",
  "DaemonAuthenticationPassword": "this-is-a-secret",
  "ImportSettingsFrom": "/tmp/settings.conf",
  "LicenseFileLocation": "/tmp/license.rli",
  "LicenseBootstrapAirgapPackagePath": "/tmp/bundle.airgap",
  "LicenseBootstrapChannelID": "4331c5fa27ad4726644993e1bd234ded",
  "LogLevel": "debug",
  "ReleaseSequence": 123,
  "TlsBootstrapType": "server-path",
  "TlsBootstrapHostname": "server.company.com",
  "TlsBootstrapCert": "/etc/server.crt",
  "TlsBootstrapKey": "/etc/server.key"
}
```

{{< note title="Initial Install Only" >}}
A file at `/etc/replicated.conf` will only be read on initial startup. It will never be written to, and once initial setup is complete and a license is installed, it will never be read again. (There are some exceptions to this rule, like changing the `DaemonAuthenticationPassword`, but in general it is not recommended to use `/etc/replicated.conf` after initial install).

These settings are explained in the following table:

| Setting | Acceptable Values | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| BypassPreflightChecks | Boolean `true` or `false` | Allows application to start without preflight checks.  This setting is optional. The default is `false` |
| DaemonAuthenticationType | `anonymous` or `password` | Replicated supports anonymous and password protected access. |
| DaemonAuthenticationPassword | Any `string` | If `DaemonAuthenticationType` is set to `password` this value is required to access the Replicated console. |
| DaemonToken | Any `string` | Authentication token used by operators for automating a cluster installation.  This setting is optional.  If omitted, a random one will be generated. |
| DockerHubUsername | Any `string` | Username that will be used to authenticate with DockerHub when pulling public images only.  This can be any valid username and is used to prevent rate limiting. |
| DockerHubPassword | Any `string` | Password that will be used to authenticate with DockerHub when pulling public images only.  This has to be a valid password for the name specified in `DockerHubUsername`. |
| ImportSettingsFrom | A file location as a `string` | If your application has any required config settings, you can supply custom values here. Replicated will read these and set them as if the user manually configured it ([see below](#configure-app-settings-automatically)). Replicated will only apply these settings on initial installation. This setting is optional. |
| ForceUseImportedSettings | Boolean `true` or `false` | Force Replicated to apply settings from the `ImportSettingsFrom` file. Settings will be applied on installation as well as app upgrades. This setting is optional. |
| RemoveImportSettingsFrom | Boolean `true` or `false` | Remove the `ImportSettingsFrom` file after use. This setting is optional. |
| LicenseFileLocation | A file location as a `string` | This is the location of an installable .rli license file on the host.  The license file used with automated installs should not require email activation. This must be an airgap license if installation will use an airgap package.  |
| LicenseBootstrapAirgapPackagePath | A file location as a `string` | This is the location of the airgap bundle on the host. When set, the automated install will proceed as an [airgapped installation](/docs/distributing-an-application/airgapped-installations/). Note that `LicenseFileLocation` must also be set to the location of the matching airgap license. This setting is optional.  |
| LicenseBootstrapChannelID | A channel ID as a `string` | This property allows specifying the installation channel for [multi-channel licenses](/docs/kb/supporting-your-customers/multichannel-licenses/).  This setting is optional.  When omitted and a multi-channel license is used, the release on the default channel will be installed. |
| LogLevel | `['debug', 'info, 'error']` | If present, this will set the log level of the Replicated daemon. This setting is optional.  |
| ReleaseSequence | The `number` of an app release | Pins the application to a release available in the license's channel, but is overridden by pins made in the vendor console. See [Pinning the Release Sequence of an Application](https://help.replicated.com/community/t/pinning-the-release-sequence-of-an-application/66).  This setting is optional and has to be omitted when `LicenseBootstrapAirgapPackagePath` is set. |
| TlsBootstrapType | `['server-path', 'self-signed', 'key-cert']` | The type of TLS cert the Replicated UI will run with. Use `self-signed` for a fully automated setup. Use `server-path` or `key-cert` to provide a static cert and key for the admin console. |
| TlsBootstrapHostname | Any `string` | The hostname to use for the Replicated-UI :8800 console.  This setting is required when `TlsBootstrapType` is set to `server-path`. |
| TlsBootstrapCert | `string` | A PEM encoded certificate file. When TlsBootstrapType is set to `server-path`, this value should be the location of a file on the host. When set to `key-cert`, the value should be the certificate in plain text with newlines replaced with `\n`. |
| TlsBootstrapKey | `string` | A PEM encoded private key file. When TlsBootstrapType is set to `server-path`, this value should be the location of a file on the host. When set to `key-cert`, the value should be the private key in plain text with newlines replaced with `\n`. |

## Configure App Settings Automatically

When your application has a Settings page, you can configure required options automatically by setting
the `ImportSettingsFrom` field in `/etc/replicated.conf`. This file is in JSON format and uses the
`config_item` names from the YAML as keys.

This file can be generated by running the command `replicatedctl app-config export --hidden > settings.conf`.

For example, if your YAML contained the following config section:

```yaml
config:
- name: general
  title: General Settings
  items:
  - name: hostname
    title: The hostname of this server.
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: port_number
    title: The port to listen on.
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: a_file
    title: Pick a file.
    type: file
  - name: a_boolean
    title: Yea or Nay
    type: bool
  - name: many_files
    title: Pick many files.
    multiple: true
```

You could then create the `settings.conf` in this format:

```json
{
 "hostname": {
   "value": "http://app.domain.com"
 },
 "port_number": {
   "value": "1123123"
 },
 "a_file": {
   "value": "/some/fake/filepath",
   "data": "<base64 encoded contents of the actual file>"
 },
 "a_boolean": {
   "value": "true"
 },
 "many_files": {
   "multi_value": [
     "/some/fake/file1",
     "/some/fake/file2"
   ],
   "multi_data": [
     "<base64 encoded contents of file1>",
     "<base64 encoded contents of file2>"
   ]
 }
}
```

## Additional Settings

Additional fields can be set in the `etc/replicated.conf` for
[using the cli to restore snapshots](/docs/snapshots/cli).
