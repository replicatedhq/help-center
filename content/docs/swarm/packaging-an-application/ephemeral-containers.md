Replicated monitors the status of the Docker Swarm services deployed in an application, and if any stop, the Admin Console will report the application as stopped. Sometimes, it's desirable to have a container stop after it runs. One common scenario where this is required is running database migrations at startup. In Replicated, an ephemeral container is one that Replicated will start, but not monitor the lifecycle of.

When deploying a Docker Swarm application, to set a service as ephemeral in Replicated, you can [label the stack service](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#labels-1) with `com.replicated.ephemeral=true`.

{{< linked_headline "Example" >}}

The following example shows an ephemeral database migration container. This container is expected to exit and Replicated will continue to show the application as started, assuming the container exits with status code 0.

```yaml
services:
  migrate-pg:
    image: replicated/pythonapp:1.4.2
    command: ["python", "manage.py", "db", "upgrade"]
    deploy:
      labels:
        com.replicated.ephemeral: "true"
      restart_policy:
        delay: 3s
        condition: on-failure
    environment:
      - DB_URL="postgresql://pythonapp:password@postgres:5432/pythonapp"
```

In the example below we show a simple python stack based on the Django framework and Postgres, and how to run database migrations.

You will notice there are three services defined in this example: `postgres`, `migrate-pg`, and `app`.

The `postgres` service is using the default Postgres image you can find on Docker Hub. The environment variables are used to configure Postgres as it starts up.

The second service is `migrate-pg`. There are three config items which are recommended for migration containers. The first is `depends_on`, which slightly delays the container startup until the `postgres` container is running. The second is `deploy.restart_policy.condition` configured to only restart the container if the exit code indicates it failed. And the final config item is `deploy.labels."com.replicated.ephemeral"` being set to `true`. This tells Replicated to not restart the container when it exits.

The final service is `app`, which uses a fairly standard config, along with the `DB_URL` Postgres connection string. It's recommended that your application fails fast if the database or schema is not ready. When this happens Docker will restart the service, so if your migrations take 30 seconds to run, your `app` service will be restarted until everything is ready.


```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:10.1
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5434:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=pythonapp
      - POSTGRES_DATABASE=pythonapp
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  migrate-pg:
    image: replicated/pythonapp:1.4.2
    command: ["python", "manage.py", "db", "upgrade"]
    deploy:
      labels:
        com.replicated.ephemeral: "true"
      restart_policy:
        delay: 3s
        condition: on-failure
    environment:
      - DB_URL="postgresql://pythonapp:password@postgres:5432/pythonapp"
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  app:
    image: replicated/pythonapp:1.4.2
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      restart_policy:
        delay: 3s
    ports:
      - "5000:3000"
    environment:
      - DB_URL="postgresql://pythonapp:password@postgres:5432/pythonapp"
```

Ephemeral containers can also be used for one-off jobs via the Docker API. This allows your application to talk directly to Docker by mounting the socket and scheduling one-off jobs as required by your application.

```yaml
services:
  job-scheduler:
    image: myapp/jobscheduler:1.0.0
    deploy:
      labels:
        com.replicated.ephemeral: "true"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
