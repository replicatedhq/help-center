A support bundle is an archive that is available for the customer to download via the Support tab of the Admin Console or the [Replicated CLI](/api/replicatedctl/replicatedctl_support-bundle/).

Contents of the support page can be customized by including markdown in the top-level of the YAML.

```yaml
replicated_api_version: "{{< replicated_api_version_current >}}"
name: ELK
console_support_markdown: |
  # Email Us for help:
  #### support@getelk.com
  Or don't, your loss.
```

The support bundle has a default timeout of 120 seconds, after which only files and commands that have completed will be included in the downloaded bundle. A custom timeout in seconds can be specified in the `support` section of the yaml.

```yaml
support:
  timeout: 300
```

{{< linked_headline "Custom Files and Commands" >}}

In addition to the [default support files](/docs/packaging-an-application/support-bundle/#default-support-files) included in the support bundle, addtional files can be added via the `support` section of your yaml. Files from within the applicationâ€™s containers can be included, as well as output of commands executed in the container. Support files and commands are supported by both the native and kubernetes schedulers. For more complex support commands it is possible to create a [config file](/docs/packaging-an-application/components-and-containers/#config-files) and execute that file from a support command. These files will be available withing the */scheduler* directory of the support bundle.

```yaml
support:
  files:
    - filename: /var/log/nginx/access.log
      source:
        replicated:
          component: Nginx
          container: my-nginx
        kubernetes:
          selector:
            run: my-nginx
  commands:
    - filename: access_last_1000.log
      command: [tail, -n1000, /var/log/nginx/access.log]
      source:
        replicated:
          component: Nginx
          container: my-nginx
        kubernetes:
          selector:
            run: my-nginx
```

{{< linked_headline "Excluding Logs From Support Bundles" >}}
If a service's logs may contain sensitive information or are simply large and not useful for your debugging processes, you can exclude that service's logs from support bundles. To do this, add the label `com.replicated.excludelogs=true` to the service in question.

```yaml
services:
  private-worker:
    image: app
    labels:
      com.replicated.excludelogs: "true"
```
