{{<legacynotice>}}

The [Replicated Ship](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship#ship) open source tool can be [installed locally](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/blob/master/README.md#installation) to manage the initial configuration and updates of a vendor's application for deployment into a customer's existing cluster.

Once Replicated Ship is installed, customers can run [`ship init <app-slug>`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/blob/master/README.md#ship-init) to launch a browser GUI with the configuration lifecycle defined in the ship.yaml. [`ship watch`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/blob/master/README.md#ship-watch) and [`ship update`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/blob/master/README.md#ship-update) can then be run in headless mode to check for updates and render new deployment artifacts when updates are available.
