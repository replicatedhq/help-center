# Contributing to Replicated Help


## First-time contributor guide

- Install & configure git on your system
- Clone the `help-wanted` repository to your own Github
	- `git clone https://github.com/replicatedhq/help-center.git`
- Create a new branch with the command `git checkout -b help-wanted/<#issue_number>`
- Make whatever edits are needed to the file(s) included in the issue
- Once your edits are complete, add changed files with `git add <file names>` or just `git add .` 
- Run `git commit`. This will open an editor where you can write a commit message.
	- first line: what was fixed?
	- Second line: "Fixed for issue <#issue_num>"
- save & close the file, then run `git push origin <#issue_number>`
- Now when you open the cloned repository in a web browser you will have the option to submit the changes as a pull request.
